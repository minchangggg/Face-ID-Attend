# Introduction
Face ID Attend is an IoT-based attendance system that uses an ESP32-CAM with AI-powered face recognition to automate student check-ins. The system captures faces in real time, verifies identities, and logs attendance data to a central server for easy management. Designed for classrooms, it delivers a fast, contactless, and reliable solution for modern attendance tracking.
